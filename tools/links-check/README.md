# Gray Paper Reader - Links Checker

This CLI tool allows you to scan files passed as parameters
in a lookout for links to the Gray Paper (GP) Reader.

Each of these links is then evaluated:

1. We check if the links points to the latest version of the GP.
2. If not, we propose an updated link.
3. We indicate if the updated link is most likely broken due to changes in the GP.

On top of that, the tool is able to:
- automatically update the links to recent version (`--write`)
- generate a JSON file that can be imported to Gray Paper Reader
  (or used as remote notes source) containing notes with filenames with the links
  (`--generate-notes`)

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @fluffylabs/links-check ./path-to-my-project/**/*.ts
