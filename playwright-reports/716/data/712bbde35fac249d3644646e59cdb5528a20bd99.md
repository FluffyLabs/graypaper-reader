GAVIN WOOD FOUNDER, POLKADOT & ETHEREUM GAVIN@PARITY.IO Abstract. We present a comprehensive and formal definition of J am , a protocol combining elements of both Polkadot and Ethereum . In a single coherent model, J am provides a global singleton permissionless object environment‚Äîmuch like the smart-contract environment pioneered by Ethereum‚Äîpaired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network, a proposition pioneered by Polkadot. J am introduces a decentralized hybrid system offering smart-contract functionality structured around a secure and scalable in-core/on-chain dualism. While the smart-contract functionality implies some similarities with Ethereum‚Äôs paradigm, the overall model of the service offered is driven largely by underlying architecture of Polkadot. J am is permissionless in nature, allowing anyone to deploy code as a service on it for a fee commensurate with the resources this code utilizes and to induce execution of this code through the procurement and allocation of core-time , a metric of resilient and ubiquitous computation, somewhat similar to the purchasing of gas in Ethereum. We already envision a Polkadot-compatible CoreChains service. 1. Introduction 1.1. Nomenclature. In this paper, we introduce a de- centralized, crypto-economic protocol to which the Polka- dot Network will transition itself in a major revision on the basis of approval by its governance apparatus. An early, unrefined, version of this protocol was first proposed in Polkadot Fellowship rfc 31 , known as CoreJam . CoreJam takes its name after the col- lect/refine/join/accumulate model of computation at the heart of its service proposition. While the CoreJam rfc suggested an incomplete, scope-limited alteration to the Polkadot protocol, J am refers to a complete and coherent overall blockchain protocol. 1.2. Driving Factors. Within the realm of blockchain and the wider Web3, we are driven by the need first and foremost to deliver resilience. A proper Web3 digital sys- tem should honor a declared service profile‚Äîand ideally meet even perceived expectations‚Äîregardless of the de- sires, wealth or power of any economic actors including in- dividuals, organizations and, indeed, other Web3 systems. Inevitably this is aspirational, and we must be pragmatic over how perfectly this may really be delivered. Nonethe- less, a Web3 system should aim to provide such radically strong guarantees that, for practical purposes, the system may be described as unstoppable . While Bitcoin is, perhaps, the first example of such a system within the economic domain, it was not general purpose in terms of the nature of the service it offered. A rules-based service is only as useful as the generality of the rules which may be conceived and placed within it. Bit- coin‚Äôs rules allowed for an initial use-case, namely a fixed- issuance token, ownership of which is well-approximated and autonomously enforced through knowledge of a secret, as well as some further elaborations on this theme. Later, Ethereum would provide a categorically more general-purpose rule set, one which was practically Tur- ing complete. 1 In the context of Web3 where we are aim- ing to deliver a massively multiuser application platform, generality is crucial, and thus we take this as a given. Beyond resilience and generality, things get more in- teresting, and we must look a little deeper to understand what our driving factors are. For the present purposes, we identify three additional goals: (1) Resilience: highly resistant from being stopped, corrupted and censored. (2) Generality: able to perform Turing-complete computation. 1 The gas mechanism did restrict what programs can execute on it by placing an upper bound on the number of steps which may be executed, but some restriction to avoid infinite-computation must surely be introduced in a permissionless setting. 1"

(3) As the mean and variance increase, then time for causal resolution (i.e. all correct implications of an event to be felt) becomes divergent across the system, causing incoherence. Setting the question of overall security aside for a mo- ment, we can manage incoherence by fragmenting the sys- tem into causally-independent subsystems, each of which is small enough to be coherent. In a resource-rich en- vironment, a bacterium may split into two rather than growing to double its size. This pattern is rather a crude means of dealing with incoherency under growth: intra- system processing has low size and total coherence, inter- system processing supports higher overall sizes but with- out coherence. It is the principle behind meta-networks such as Polkadot, Cosmos and the predominant vision of a scaled Ethereum (all to be discussed in depth shortly). Such systems typically rely on asynchronous and simplis- tic communication with ‚Äúsettlement areas‚Äù which provide a small-scoped coherent state-space to manage specific in- teractions such as a token transfer. The present work explores a middle-ground in the an- tagonism, avoiding the persistent fragmentation of state- space of the system as with existing approaches. We do this by introducing a new model of computation which pipelines a highly scalable, mostly coherent element to a synchronous, fully coherent element. Asynchrony is not avoided, but we bound it to the length of the pipeline and substitute the crude partitioning we see in scalable sys- tems so far with a form of ‚Äúcache aÔ¨Äinity‚Äù as it typically seen in multi- cpu systems with a shared ram . Unlike with snark -based L2-blockchain techniques for scaling, this model draws upon crypto-economic mecha- nisms and inherits their low-cost and high-performance profiles and averts a bias toward centralization. 1.4.

We then continue with the full protocol definition split into two parts: firstly the correct on-chain state-transition formula helpful for all nodes wishing to validate the chain state, and secondly, in sections 14 and 19 the honest strat- egy for the off-chain actions of any actors who wield a validator key. The main body ends with a discussion over the per- formance characteristics of the protocol in section 20 and finally conclude in section 21. The appendix contains various additional material im- portant for the protocol definition including the pvm in appendices A & B, serialization and Merklization in ap- pendices C & D and cryptography in appendices E, G & H. We finish with an index of terms which includes the values of all simple constant terms used in the work in appendix I, and close with the bibliography. 2. Previous Work and Present Trends In the years since the initial publication of the Ethereum YP , the field of blockchain development has grown immensely. Other than scalability, development has been done around underlying consensus algorithms, smart-contract languages and machines and overall state environments. While interesting, these latter subjects are mostly out scope of the present work since they generally do not impact underlying scalability. 2.1. Polkadot.

It was a major point of the original Polkadot pro- posal, a scalable heterogeneous multichain, to deliver high- performance through partition and distribution of the workload over multiple host machines. In doing so it took an explicit position that composability would be lowered. Polkadot‚Äôs constituent components, parachains are, prac- tically speaking, highly isolated in their nature. Though a message passing system ( xcmp ) exists it is asynchronous, coarse-grained and practically limited by its reliance on a high-level slowly evolving interaction language xcm . As such, the composability offered by Polkadot be- tween its constituent chains is lower than that of
